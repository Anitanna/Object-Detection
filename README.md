# Object-Detection

Human detection can be the task of locating humans from an image. It is an important application in the field of business and surveillance. So, the task can be automated which can help humans simplify their task.From a variety of object detection system, we are using YOLOv3 and OpenCV.

## YOLOv3

You only look once (YOLO) is a real time object detection system. YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once, Version 3) is a real time object detection algorithm which uses features learned by a deep convolutional neural network to detect an object. We have used the COCO dataset which contains challenging, high-quality visual datasets for computer vision. YOLO applies a neural network to the entire image to predict bounding boxes and their probabilities. In this project, we have used pretrained model.

## OpenCV

Open-Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. The library is used to detect and recognize faces, identify 
objects, classify human actions, etc.
